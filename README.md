This was built with React and utalizes the Flux Pattern.

### Game Difficulty Logic Explained

#### Easy:
After the user picks a box, the computer reviews each open board spot and picks a random one.

#### Regular:
- The computer will review the board and look for the winning move.
- Next the computer will review the board and look for the defensive move to stop user from getting 3 in a row.

#### Impossible:
- The user can not win. The user can only cause a tie.
- The computer has the same logic as regular except if those two scenarios don't apply it will make the necessary move based on the board layout.
